Project 4 - CS315 with Dr.Raphael Finkel - Word Counter

Author: Tanner Palin

Sources: geeksforgeeks.org was extremely helpful with teaching me how to use and implement vectors.

Sources: geeksforgeeks.org also helped me firmly grasp the idea and implementation of external chaining.

Sources: Will Shapiro for helping me come up with an efficient hashing equation.

Sources: www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com helped me implement QuickSort using vectors.

Purpose: This program takes in the word contents from a text file and hashes them in a way that helps you
determine the most commonly used words in a given file.

Usage: I ask that you redirect standard input to the text file you are wanting to analyze.
./wordCount < data.txt

Bugs: So far I haven't found any bugs but that may change! Please let me know :)
